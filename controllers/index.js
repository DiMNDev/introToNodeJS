We can CREATE content for other people to READ. We can change it, if our case requires, with UPDATE, and when information is no longer relevant, we can DELETE it. These methods provide a foundation of value to the world. From small and large businesses that need to track financial and operational metrics, to worlds explored in video games with relational events and statistics. From small local projects running on a local machine, handling data that lives together in one location to larger scale projects with many intricate moving parts, events triggering at different times that need to be handled in a specific order to connect clients. It wouldn't be possible without Create, Read, Update and Delete. ðŸ’© we need it.";
